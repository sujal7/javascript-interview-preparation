# Question and Answers

## Debugging Techniques

1. Explain debugging & run-time v/s design-time errors

   Ans: Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in the application.

   - Run-time errors are errors that occur during the execution of the program. Design-time errors are errors that occur at the time of coding at the time of development.
   - Run-time errors are faced by the end users. Design-time errors are for developers as they can be corrected at the time of compilation.

2. What is a developer tool?

   Ans: A developer tool is a software that helps the developers to inspect their web pages.

3. What is a responsive web design(RWD)?

   Ans: Responsive web design is a web design technique that makes web pages more usable on different devices.

4. What is a breakpoint & How do you place it?

   Ans: A breakpoint is a point in the code where the debugger stops the execution of the program for debugging or to evaluate the values of various variables. We can place a breakpoint by opening the sources of the program and clicking on the line number.

5. How does the watch tool help in debugging?

   Ans: The watch tool helps in monitoring multiple variables and expressions throughout the code.

6. What is stack trace?

   Ans: A stack trace works on the call stack which shows a stack of functions and subroutines currently under execution. The call stack is used to analyse contents of each subroutine and how they run.

7. How to navigate through code while debugging?

   Ans: We can navigate through the code by using the step-over, step-into, step-out and step-over-all buttons in the developer tools.

8. What are event listeners?

   Ans: Event listeners are used to listen for events on a web page.

9. How does the programmatic breakpoint work?

   Ans: The programmatic breakpoint works by using the debugger statements in the code.

10. How to place a conditional breakpoint?

    Ans: We can add conditional breakpoint by right clicking on the line number and entering our expression. If the expression evaluates to true, the breakpoint is enabled.

11. How do the DOM breakpoints work?

    Ans: The DOM breakpoints work under subtree modifications, attribute modifications and node removal.

12. How does XHR/Fetch breakpoints work?

    Ans: The XHR/Fetch breakpoints works when there is any request to the server. We can also add URL patterns to the breakpoint.

13. How to debug the code with exceptions?

    Ans: Exception breakpoint is used to debug the code when there is an exception.
    We can turn on the pause on exceptions in the developer tools.

14. Explain different console object methods

    Ans: The console object methods are as follows:

    - log() - logs a message to the console.
    - info() - logs an informational message to the console.
    - warn() - logs a warning message to the console.
    - error() - logs an error message to the console.
    - table() - logs a table to the console.
    - debug() - logs a debug message to the console.

15. What does the console.time() method do?

    Ans: The console.time() method is used to measure the time taken to execute a block of code. It can be useful when we want to check the response time of our code & manage it.

16. How to check the current execution time?

    Ans: We can use console.timeLog() method to check the current execution time.
